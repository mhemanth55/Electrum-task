#### 1. write a shell script to check whether a string is palindrome or not. if yes, count the length of the string. If No, reverse the string.
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a string"
read input
reverse=""
len=${#input}

for (( i=$len-1; i>=0; i-- ))
do
    reverse="$reverse${input:$i:1}"
done

if [ $input == $reverse ]
then
    echo "$input is palidrome"
    echo "lenght of a string is: $len"
else
    echo "$input is not palindrome"
    echo $reverse
fi
```

#### 2. Lambda currently has an execution time limit of X minutes. Say you have a long running function that requires more than X minutes to run. How would you design your Lambda + whatever AWS services to execute this function?
```
To address the scenario where a function exceeds the time limit of AWS Lambda, there are a few steps 
I would take to design an effective solution as below.

Firstly, I would break down the long-running function into smaller tasks that can be executed within
the Lambda's time limit. Each task would handle
a specific subtask or a portion of the overall computation.

To orchestrate and manage the execution flow between these smaller tasks, I would utilize AWS Step Functions.
Step Functions allow us to coordinate multiple AWS services as a workflow. I would create a Step Functions 
state machine that invokes individual Lambda functions for each smaller task. This way, we can ensure that
the long-running function is executed efficiently while staying within Lambda's time limit.

In the event that a Lambda function reaches the time limit, I would leverage the integration between 
AWS Lambda and Step Functions.The Lambda function can signal Step Functions to save the current state 
and exit gracefully. Step Functions can then trigger the next Lambda function in the sequence to resume
the execution. By using this approach, we can effectively divide the workload and continue the execution seamlessly.

If the long-running function produces intermediate results that can be stored and retrieved later, 
I would consider using AWS services like Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB. These services can be used 
to store the intermediate results, allowing subsequent invocations of the function to resume from 
where the previous invocation left off. This ensures progress is not lost and the computation can continue smoothly.

However, if the long-running function involves heavy computational tasks that cannot be easily divided 
into smaller tasks, I would suggest considering AWS Batch. AWS Batch is designed for running batch 
computing workloads. It allows us to execute heavy computational tasks in a distributed and scalable manner,
managing the required resources and scheduling of containerized tasks.

By following these steps, breaking down the function, utilizing Step Functions, storing intermediate
results, and considering alternative compute options, we can design a comprehensive solution to execute 
long-running functions efficiently.

#### 3. How would you ‘lock down’ a SaaS service, so it is only accessible by on premises IP Addresses?
```
Considering that saas service is on AWS, to lock down a SaaS service hosted on the AWS cloud and allow access only
from on-premises IP addresses, I will follow some steps like

Firstly, I will detrmine the IP addresses or range of IP addresses associated with my on-premises network that 
should be allowed access to the SaaS service.

Next, I will configure the security group associated with the AWS resources hosting the SaaS service. Security 
groups act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic. After that I will locate the security group
associated with the SaaS service and modify its inbound rules and the will add a new inbound rule that specifies
the source IP address (or range) as the on-premises IP addresses. This allows incoming traffic only from the 
specified IP addresses while blocking all others.

In addition to security groups, AWS also provides Network ACLs (Access Control Lists) at the subnet level. 
Network ACLs act as stateless firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. 
I wil also adjust the inbound rules of the Network ACLs associated with the subnets hosting the SaaS service
to allow access from the on-premises IP addresses and deny access from other sources.

We can also do below steps,
if we have established any Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between our on-premises network and 
the AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) hosting the SaaS service. In this case we need to ensure that the 
VPN connection is properly configured and secure. This adds an extra layer of encryption and ensures the traffic
between your on-premises network and the SaaS service remains secure.

By implementing these type of measures like configuring security groups, Network ACLs, and ensuring a 
secure VPN connection, we can restrict access to the SaaS service on AWS or any cloud only to the specified 
on-premises IP addresses. 
```

#### 4. Consider you are given a collection of devices/mobiles (more than 10,000) which interact with the service for a real time game. Design a real-time sub zero lag gaming platform for real timeness , suggest products and strategy to achieve the functionality of the service.
```
I would design a real-time sub-zero lag gaming platform by considering various factors such as network latency, 
server performance, and infrastructure scalability. To achieve this, I would leverage the following AWS services and strategies:

First, I will utilize AWS Global Infrastructure to ensure low latency for players worldwide.
By deploying gaming servers in multiple AWS regions strategically placed near target player
populations, we can minimize network delays.

To handle varying player demand and ensure optimal performance, I will employ AWS Auto Scaling.
This service dynamically adjusts server capacity based on the current player activity,
allowing us to handle sudden spikes without impacting performance.

To provide an isolated and secure environment for hosting the gaming platform, I would set up a
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using AWS. This would enable complete control over network configuration and security.

For running the gaming servers, I would choose high-performance Amazon EC2 instances such as the
Amazon EC2 C5n or C6gn. These instances offer high network performance and low-latency networking,
making them suitable for real-time gaming workloads.

To simplify the deployment, operation, and scaling of dedicated game servers, I will try to leverage Amazon GameLift.
This managed service handles server fleet management, including matchmaking, game session management, and scaling.

To route players to the nearest gaming servers and reduce latency, I would utilize Amazon Route 53.
This highly available and scalable DNS service directs players to the most optimal server location
based on latency considerations.

For efficient content delivery, I would leverage Amazon CloudFront, a global content delivery network (CDN).
CloudFront caches game assets at edge locations worldwide, ensuring low-latency and high-speed delivery to players.

To store player profiles, game statistics, and other dynamic data, I would use Amazon DynamoDB, 
a highly scalable and low-latency NoSQL database. DynamoDB's auto-scaling capabilities would 
ensure it can handle varying read and write demands.

Lastly, for real-time analytics I will use AWS services such as Amazon Kinesis Data Streams or 
Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka. These services capture and analyze real-time game data, 
enabling features such as live player telemetry, heatmaps, and game balancing.
```

#### 5. What is the type of architecture, where half of the workload is on the public load while at the same time half of it is on the local storage? How you emulate your local machine as a local storage
```
To achieve this setup, I would follow these steps:

First, I would set up a Kubernetes cluster using a platform like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 
on the public cloud and create another Kubernetes cluster on the private cloud infrastructure.

Next, I would label the nodes in each Kubernetes cluster to identify their location. For example, 
I would label the nodes in the public cloud cluster as "public" and the nodes in the private cloud cluster as "private".

Then, when deploying workloads, I would use node affinity to schedule them based on their location requirements. 
In the workload manifests (e.g., Deployment or StatefulSet), I would utilize the nodeSelector or nodeAffinity 
fields and set them to match the appropriate node labels. For instance, for workloads that need to run on the public cloud,
I would set the node affinity to match the "public" label.

To emulate my local machine as local storage, I would leverage Kubernetes' persistent volumes and persistent volume claims (PVC).
I would create a local persistent volume on my machine and define a PVC that requests storage from that volume. 
The PVC would be configured with the ReadWriteOnce access mode to ensure it can only be mounted by a single pod.

In order to assign workloads to the local storage on my machine, I would specify the PVC that requests storage 
from the local persistent volume as a volume mount in the pod specification for each workload.

Finally, I would deploy the workloads across both clusters, ensuring an even distribution between the public and private clouds.
By using the appropriate node affinity and volume mounts, I would match the desired location and storage requirements for each workload.

By following these steps, I can effectively run half of the workloads on the public cloud and the other half on the private cloud,
while emulating my local machine as local storage within the Kubernetes setup.
